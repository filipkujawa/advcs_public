### Advanced Computer Science 23-24

```
This is the capstone course in the software design pathway in which advanced computer Science aims to be a class where students work to expand their programming knowledge beyond AP Computer Science A. This course will have an emphasis on building and applying concepts in data structures. Students will learn such topics as generics, linked lists, stacks, sets, hash tables, maps, graphs, heaps, priority queues, and trees. Students will do performance analysis (Big O) and develop applications pertaining to each data structure. In addition, students will explore and utilize concepts in search, sorting, design, file i/o, networking, and multithreading.
